    "=##=##=##=##=##=## Motion hash starts with this line ##=##=##=##=##=##=  Fund development of NuBox, a Peerbox fork (peerbox.me) with Peerbox functionality extended to cover all Nu specifics like motion voting and data feeds.  When motion passes, I will start working on this and within 4 weeks I will deliver:  Standards compliant, GPG signed Debian repository for NuBox (arm and x86_64) Signed Nu wallet binaries with accompanying tools Port of peerbox command with extended, Nu specific commands Documentation on how to install and use NuBox Any feature that users need but I have possibly omitted in this post with condition that it is communicated in first two weeks since motion passes and is not excessive/unrealistic Source code for the full product. Nu version updates for a period of 1 year, as long as they are compatible with existing codebase and don't require major architectural overhauls. After this period new motion will be started to extend maintenance period. Nu will pay me 4000 NBT upfront for this project. I will not be dealing with marketing, logo design and website. I propose that the same designer of all other Nu logos design this one too and that projects website is integrated into the rest of the project properly.
